"""
Write a Python script that provides some stats about Nginx logs stored in MongoDB:
Database: logs
Collection: nginx
Display (same as the example):
first line: x logs where x is the number of documents in this collection
second line: Methods:
5 lines with the number of documents with the method = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"] in this order (see example below - warning: itâ€™s a tabulation before each line)
one line with the number of documents with:
method=GET
path=/status
You can use this dump as data sample: dump.zip
The output of your script must be exactly the same as the example
